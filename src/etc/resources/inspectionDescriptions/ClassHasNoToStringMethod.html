            This inspection reports any classes with no toString() method.
            <p>
            This inspection will use the exclude settings from the plugin configuration to ignore classes having fields
            not supposed to be dumped.
            <br>An additional settings is to exclude certain classes by using a regular expression
            matching the classname.
            <br>Exception, deprecated, abstract or enum classes can also be excluded.
            <p>
            This inspection can use on-the-fly code inspection by enabling it to show errors as warnings. This will highlight
            the classname on-the-fly in the java editor.
